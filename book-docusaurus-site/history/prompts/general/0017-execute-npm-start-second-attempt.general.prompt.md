## Prompt

```
npm start
```

## Response

Okay, I'm starting the Docusaurus development server now. This will build your site and open it in your web browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

Please let me know once you see the site and if the new theme looks good to you, especially with the logo in the hero section.
```
