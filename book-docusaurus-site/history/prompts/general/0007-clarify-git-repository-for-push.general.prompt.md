## Prompt

```
kindly push iton github https://github.com/hadi2031991/Physical_AI_-_Humanoid_Robotics_Textbookbook-docusaurus-site kindlypush
```

## Response

I see a discrepancy in the GitHub repository name.

Your current remote origin is set to:
`https://github.com/hadi2031991/Physical_AI_-_Humanoid_Robotics_Textbook.git`

However, you've provided the link:
`https://github.com/hadi2031991/Physical_AI_-_Humanoid_Robotics_Textbookbook-docusaurus-site` (which appears to be a different repository or a typo in the name).

Could you please confirm which repository I should push the changes to?
```
