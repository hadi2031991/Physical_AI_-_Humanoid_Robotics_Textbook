## Prompt

```
i want the logo of physical ai will cover the hero section
```

## Response

I have updated the homepage's CSS to display the logo as a background for the hero section, as you requested.

If your development server is still running, it should have automatically refreshed with the new change. If not, you can restart it with:

```
npm start
```

Please take a look and let me know if it meets your expectations. The text might be hard to read against the logo, so we can add a semi-transparent overlay if needed.
```
