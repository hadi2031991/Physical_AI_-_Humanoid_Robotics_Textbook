## Prompt

```
i want the logo of physical ai will cover the hero section
```

## Response

I understand. You want to make the logo the background of the hero section on the homepage.

To do this, I will need to modify the styling of the hero section. I will start by examining the homepage's code to determine the best way to apply this change.
```
