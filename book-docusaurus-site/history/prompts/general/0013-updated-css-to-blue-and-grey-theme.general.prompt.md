## Prompt

```
yes blue base and grey
```

## Response

I have updated the `src/css/custom.css` file to a blue and grey theme as you requested.

To see the changes, you can start the Docusaurus development server by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

This will open a new browser window with the updated theme. Let me know what you think of the new colors!
```
