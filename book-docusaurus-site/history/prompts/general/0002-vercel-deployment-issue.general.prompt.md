## Prompt

```

```

## Response

I understand you're having trouble with your Vercel deployment. The `docusaurus.config.ts` file is currently configured for GitHub Pages, which is likely causing the issue.

Could you please provide the following:
1.  The Vercel deployment URL (the one that's not working).
2.  Any error messages or logs from the Vercel deployment.

In the meantime, I can prepare a change to your `docusaurus.config.ts` to make it compatible with Vercel.
```
