## Prompt

```
https://github.com/hadi2031991/Physical_AI_-_Humanoid_Robotics_Textbook u have changes which i mention above so kindly check and push there too
```

## Response

Thank you for confirming the repository.

Regarding the code snippets you provided, they seem to be Python code for AI agents, which is different from the Docusaurus (JavaScript/TypeScript) project we are working on. Therefore, I will not be applying those changes.

I will now proceed to commit and push the changes to `docusaurus.config.ts` and the `history/` directory to the `001-rag-chatbot-system` branch of the confirmed repository.
```
