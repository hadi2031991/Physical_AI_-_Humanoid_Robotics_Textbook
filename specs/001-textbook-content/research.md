## Phase 0 Research Findings

Due to the explicit and detailed nature of the user's initial request and the specified plan steps, no significant external research tasks were identified as necessary before proceeding with the design phase. The core technologies (Docusaurus, Markdown, GitHub Pages) and the project's structure were already defined within the feature specification and the initial planning input.

### Decisions & Rationale

- **Decision**: Proceed directly to design (Phase 1) without a dedicated research phase.
- **Rationale**: The core technical stack and structural requirements are well-defined in the feature specification and user-provided plan. No ambiguous technical choices or significant unknowns requiring external investigation were present.
- **Alternatives Considered**: N/A, as the path was clear from the outset.
