# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Accuracy, Clarity, and Academic Tone
All content must be factually accurate, clearly written, and maintain a rigorous academic tone suitable for a university-level textbook.

### II. Future-Oriented Perspective
The textbook will explore the collaborative future of humans, AI, and robotics, presenting a forward-looking and integrated view.

### III. Modular Chapter Organization
Content is structured in self-contained, modular chapters to facilitate reading, updates, and curriculum integration.

## Technical Constraints

- Must use the Spec-Kit Plus `book-docusaurus` template.
- All book content must be generated as Markdown files located in the `/docs/` directory.
- Sidebars and navigation configuration must be auto-generated to ensure consistency.

## Project Scope

- **Content Generation:** Produce 14 chapters plus appendices.
- **Scaffolding:** Set up the complete Docusaurus project structure.
- **Deployment:** Configure the project for deployment to GitHub Pages.
- **Consistency:** Ensure uniform structure, formatting, and navigation across the entire textbook.

## Governance

This constitution guides the project's development. All contributions must align with these principles and constraints. Amendments require team consensus and documentation.
